Some features, like the Secret Finder, are allowed under Hypixel's rules. These waypoints are generated from a static set of coordinates, similar to fairy soul waypoints, which have been confirmed as allowed by Simon. The Dungeon Guide Mod has been explicitly approved by a Hypixel admin, ensuring it adheres to server rules.
